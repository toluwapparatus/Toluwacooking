    <h4>Toluwa-style Knuckle Sandwich</h4>
    <p>Here in the Toluwa school of thought we believe that there is no conflict that can not be resolved using oral communication as opposed to the communication of the fists.
        However, if a situation does arise where you have no choice but to run somebody's fade I hope you can remember the words I plan on imparting to you today.
    </p>
    <uo>
        <li>Hands (like really bad. Use your hands guys. You are not <a href="https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-22-2018/0kvPCY.gif">Sanji</a>, you will get dropped)</li>
        <li>Legs (Now I know what I just said, let me cook ight)</li>
        <li>Eyes (Guess what for)</li>
        <li>The rest of your body tbh</li>
        <li>Kidney (<em>optional</em>)</li>
    </uo>
    <p>Now, make sure you are not in a crowd (you don't want to get jumped) and make sure you're not fighting a samoan (you will lose. I can not save you) and you aren't fighting anybody while they are with their girl(you aren't beating the case).</p>
    <ol> 
        <li>You want to assess your opponent. What is their height? Their weight? How does he smell? Would he be considered conventionally attractive by society's standards? Is he actually attractive? All these variable will be key in your impending takedown of him.</li>
        <li>Hit first and hit hard. You have heard it said before but I raise you the question: How will we hit?</li>
        <li>Release your aura. Right before your first contact you want to disorient him so must release your killer aura wafting towards him. Don't act obtuse, if you are here then you undoubtedly are a dweeb, but that will be your biggest strength in this battle. Simply lift your arms up to the sky and it will flow from you endlessly like you are niagara falls. His stance will waver and it is now that you will strike.</li>
        <li> Strike! Utilize the fact that your arms are straight up into the air and bring your open palms crashing into his ears. Consider him effectively discombobulated.</li>
        <li>Finish the job! It is now that your legs come into play. We aren't felons so our aim isn't to maim but to dispatch. While he is off balance you must rush towards him as fast as possible and embrace your assailant slowly and softly. Take him up into your arms and use your all-encompassing killer aura to put him out of commission. It is rumored that this tactic is successful due to you activating a dormant hormone leftover from childhood in the targets brain. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>With this you have successfully dispatched your attacker
         and mitigated any and all injury to either party! 
        You're a genius! 
        However, as i have a copyright on this recipe you forfeit 
        all the clout, respect, acclaim, street cred, honeys, etc. you would have gained otherwise to me. 
        But you're alive! Which is really more important anyway.</p>

        <p>Be sure to relentlessly reap the rewards of using this flawless recipe! Enjoy!</p>
