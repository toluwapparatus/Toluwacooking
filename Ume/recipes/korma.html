    <h4>Toluwa-style Lamb Korma</h4>
    <p>Behold the nigh boundless majesty of this meal! 
        A masterclass in texture and flavor in cuisine, 
        it is usually paired with saffron rice or naan bread. 
        However if you desire to capture the peak Toluwa-experience consuming this meal,
         it is suggested you eat it with both naan (for the overachievers try Peshuawari!) AND rice.</p>

<p>As for ingredients make sure that you have:</p>

<uo>
    <li>1 .lb lamb steak</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
    <li>1½ tablespoon garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li><em>Spices</em></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon cilantro</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
</uo>

<ol><li>First, promptly activate your Instant Pot in SAUTE Forme. Meditate for 30 seconds. 
    Add oil, chopped onions and ginger-garlic paste and continue to saute for 3 extra minutes,
     until the onions become as soft as slug snot.  
     Now add a pinch of salt. Slowly debilitate that hypothetical slug. In doing so speed up 
     the sweating of the onions. 
     Surely being first-hand witnesses to a homocide will alter the trajectory of their lives forever. 
     God bless their pour souls.</li>
     <li>Add in tomato paste with ¼ cup of water. 
        This deglazes the pot, helps blend the tomato paste and also gives the illusion that the slug is bleeding profusely. 
        Add all spices and stir well.</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk, remaining water and lamb cubes to represent the Holy Lamb Jesus Christ. He is taking the slug home to the giant palm leaf in the sky. Stir well. And then pray. 
        </li>
        <li>Lock the lid in place and activate Manual or Pressure Cook Forme for 20 minutes on sealing mode.
             Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes at least, 
             and then follow the quick release instructions. 
             If not in a rush, give the meal the physical, emotional and spiritual space to release naturally. 
        </li>
        <li>Add chopped cilantro and ground cardamom. 
            You can add a few drips of fresh lime juice before serving,
             but this is totally an optional step.</li>
    </ol>
