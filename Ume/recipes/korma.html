    <h4>Toluwa-style Lamb Korma</h4>
    <p>Behold the nigh boundless majesty of this meal! A masterclass in texture and flavor in cuisine, it is usually paired with saffron rice or naan bread. However if you desire to capture the peak Toluwa-experience consuming this meal it is suggested you eat it with both naan (for the overacheivers try Peshuawari!) AND rice.</p>

<p>As for ingredients make sure that you have:</p>

<uo>
    <li>1 .lb lamb steak</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium onion</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
    <li>1½ tablespoon garlic</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li><em>Spices</em></li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon cilantro</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
</uo>

<ol><li>First, promptly activate your Instant Pot in SAUTE Forme. Meditate for 30 seconds. 
    Add oil, chopped onions and ginger-garlic paste and continue to saute for 3 extra minutes,
     until the onions become as soft as slug snot.  
     Now add a pinch of salt. Slowly debilitate that hypothetical slug. In doing so speed up 
     the sweating of the onions. Surely being first-hand witnesses to a homocide will alter the trajectory of their lives forever</li>
     <li></li>
    </ol>
